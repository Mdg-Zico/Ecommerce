No API Integration: This project is not a fully functional ecommerce site, as it lacks backend API integration for dynamic product management, user authentication, and payment processing.
Static Data: The product information and other content are hardcoded for demonstration purposes, making it a static representation of an ecommerce site rather than a dynamic application.


Technology Stack

Front-end:

HTML: For structure and content.

CSS: For styling and layout.

React.js: For building the user interface components and managing the application's state.


Future Enhancements
API Integration: Implement RESTful API endpoints for dynamic data fetching, allowing real-time product updates, user authentication, and order processing.

Shopping Cart Functionality: Add features to enable users to add products to a shopping cart, manage quantities, and proceed to checkout.

User Authentication: Implement user registration and login functionalities to provide a personalized shopping experience.
